TW1 Exploratory Data Analysis
Learning objectives:

Be able to understand data and conduct descriptive statistics. 
Be able to conduct exploratory data analysis through visualization. 
Problem-solving problems

You will work on a set of problems of exploratory data analysis. This work should be done by your assigned team.  

Starter code: TW1-visualization.zip
Your team can decide how to collaborate on solving problems. 

Part 0: 

Before you start working on the problems, please check the following:

Make sure that all members in your team have GitHub account AND send me (Git username: baew-seattleu) an invitation. Also clone your Git repo on your local machine. 
Part 1:

Given a Python notebook, create cells to solve each of the following problems.
(1) For each field of the data, what is the mean of the data? What is the median? What is the mode of the data?

(2) For each field of the data, give the five-number summary, minimum, the first quartile (Q1), median, the third quartile (Q3), and maximum of the data.

(3) For each field of the data, visulize a boxplot of the data and compare it to your answer in (b).

(4) For Sales, visualize distribution of the data using histogram. Comment on the dataâ€™s modality (i.e., bimodal, trimodal, etc.). 

(5) For Sales, visualize the trend of the data over time using a graph.

(6) For each pair (TV-Sales, Radio-Sales, Newspaper-Sales), calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient factor r.

(7) For each pair (TV-Sales, Radio-Sales, Newspaper-Sales), visualize scatter graph.

(8) Discuss what the differences are between the three: (1) boxplot, (2) histogram, and (3) scatter plot with respect to founding.

Notes: Students should push an updated notebook file to his/her/their Git repo. 

Part 2: 
Write a summary of what you find from the data.

Submission(s)

Each student should make individual submissions. 

Part 1:
Push an updated notebook file to his/her/their Git repo. 
You do not need to submit any notebook files to Canvas.
I will visit your Github to check the file. 
Part 2:
Submit a summary of your learning to Canvas. Your document should include:
Full names of your team members who work on the assignment.
URL links to the notebook of each student on GitHub repo. 
A summary of what you learned from the teamwork assignment.
